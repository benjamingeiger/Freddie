# Freddie

Freddie will be an interpreter and compiler for the [Rockstar
language](https://codewithrockstar.com) language, implemented in F\#.

Baby steps so far.


## Why?

Why write an interpreter for a language that already has several?

Several reasons.

1. I wanted a reason to write something substantial in F\#.

2. It's been a while since I've written anything that I could reasonably show
   off to potential employers.

3. Why wouldn't I want to be a rockstar developer?


## How?

Clone the repo and run `dotnet run --project src/Interpreter`.

Don't expect to be wowed just yet. I'm only putting the code up in order to get
help with it should I need it. I'll polish this up when it's closer to feature
complete.
